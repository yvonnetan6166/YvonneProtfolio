											<h3>Overview</h3>
											<p>Adventure Works (AW) is a big company that makes and sells metal and composite bicycles in North America, Europe, and Australia. It's based in Bothell, Washington, and has 290 employees. They also have regional sales offices in different countries. In 2000, AW bought a plant in Mexico called Importadores Neptuno (IN) that makes parts for their bicycles. These parts are sent to Bothell, where they put everything together to make the final bicycles. In 2001, IN became the only place that makes and sells touring bicycles.
									<p>In this retail analysis, we'll use Power BI to explore sales, costs, and profits for resellers and online customers, focusing on bicycles and metals-related products sold globally.
