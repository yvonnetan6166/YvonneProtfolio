											<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
											<p>The Google Merchandise Store (GMS) is an online platform that sells branded merchandise of the tech giant, Google. The purpose of this data visualization business case is to analyze the website's digital marketing performance and make data-driven decisions to improve the website's performance. The data was collected using BigQuery, and then analyzed and visualized using Tableau. The project analyzes 15 key attributes, 12 KPIs, and 6 filters to provide insights on the store's digital marketing efforts.

									<h3>Business Problem</h3>
									<p>The GMS website's business problem is low website traffic and low conversion rates. The website's low traffic and low conversion rates can be attributed to ineffective digital marketing campaigns, low user engagement, and slow website load times. The business problem's root cause is a lack of insights into website traffic and user behavior.</header>

									<h3>Analysis Approach</h3>
									<p>The analysis approach involves analyzing the website's digital marketing performance using Google Analytics data. The data is analyzed using various metrics such as total sessions, pageviews, bounce rate, exit rate, and time on page. The data is then visualized using Tableau to gain insights into user behavior and website performance. The analysis approach also includes identifying key trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data to make data-driven decisions to improve the website's performance.

									<p>Google Analytics tracks user interactions with a website or mobile app and collects data on user behavior, such as pageviews, clicks, sessions, and conversion events. The data collected by Google Analytics is organized into a hierarchical structure with three levels: account, property, and view.
										<li>Account: An account is the highest level of organization in Google Analytics. It represents a business entity, organization, or individual that owns one or more websites or mobile apps. Each Google account can have multiple Google Analytics accounts.</li>
										<li>Property: A property is a website, mobile app, or other digital asset that is being tracked by Google Analytics. Each property is associated with a unique tracking ID that is used to collect and send data to Google Analytics. A Google Analytics account can have multiple properties.</li>
										<li>View: A view is a specific configuration of a property. It represents a subset of the data collected by a property and can be used to apply filters or transformations to the data. For example, a view can be used to exclude traffic from internal IP addresses or to filter out spam traffic. A property can have multiple views.</li>
										</p><p>In Google Analytics, data is collected by inserting a tracking code on each page of a website or in a mobile app. When a user interacts with the website or app, the tracking code sends data to Google Analytics, which processes and aggregates the data into reports.
                                            <p>The data collected by Google Analytics is stored in a database that is optimized for reporting and analysis.
                                            <p>Overall, the relationship between the account, property, and view in Google Analytics allows for flexible and granular tracking of user behavior and provides a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing digital marketing efforts.
                                            </p>

                                <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                                           <p>1. Optimize the website load time: The analysis found that the website takes too long to load, which might be causing people to leave quickly. To fix this, the business can make the images smaller, reduce the number of requests to the server, and use a content delivery network (CDN) to speed things up.
                                                <br>2.Focus on high-performing channels and countries: Some ways of reaching customers and certain countries are doing better than others, according to the analysis. To get the most out of their efforts, the business should put more resources into these successful channels and countries.
                                                    <br>3.Improve content for high-bounce pages: The analysis discovered that some pages have a lot of people leaving right away. The business can investigate why this happens and then make those pages better to keep visitors engaged.
                                                        <br>4.Develop a mobile-first strategy: The analysis showed that more and more people are using mobile devices to visit the website. To give them a better experience, the business should make sure the site works well on mobile and maybe even create a mobile app.
