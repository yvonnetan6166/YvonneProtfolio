									<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
									<p>As a FinTech company, we want to keep a close eye on how our loans are doing and how likely it is that people might not pay them back. To do that, we need to generate Roll Rate Report, Loss Provisioning Report, and Vintage Analysis Report based on our loan data.
								</header>
							</p>
								<header>
									<h3>Business Problem</h3>
									   <p>We need to assess the credit risk of our loan portfolio and make decisions on loan origination and loss provisioning. However, the manual process of generating these reports is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks flexibility. We need an automated and scalable solution to generate these reports to support our risk management and credit decision-making.

									<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
										<li>Develop an automated solution to generate Roll Rate Report, Loss Provisioning Report, and Vintage Analysis Report based on loan data.</li>
										<li>Visualize the loan portfolio performance and credit risk using interactive dashboards and reports.</li>
										<li>Identify the drivers of loan defaults and assess the credit risk of the loan portfolio by segment and vintage.</li>

									<h3>Data Sources</h3>
									<p>The data sources for this analysis include the FinTech company's loan data, which consists of loan-level data on borrowers, loan characteristics, payment history, and loan status.

                                <header>
									<h3>Analysis Approach</h3>
									<p>We will use a data analytics approach to generate Roll Rate Report, Loss Provisioning Report, and Vintage Analysis Report based on the FinTech company's loan data. The analysis will consist of the following steps:</p>

                                    <p>   1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: We will clean and preprocess the loan data to ensure data quality and consistency. This includes removing duplicates, filling in missing data, and standardizing data formats.
                                    <p>   2. Roll Rate Analysis: We will calculate the Roll Rate Report, which shows the percentage of borrowers who default on their loans over a given period. This will involve segmenting the loan portfolio by vintage, loan type, and other relevant criteria to identify patterns and trends in the roll rates.
                                    <p>   3. Loss Provisioning Analysis: We will use the Roll Rate Report to estimate the expected losses for the loan portfolio based on historical loss rates. This will involve segmenting the portfolio by risk category and vintage and using statistical models to estimate the expected losses.
                                    <p>  4. Vintage Analysis: We will analyze the performance of loans originated in different periods (vintages) to identify trends in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. This will involve segmenting the portfolio by vintage and other relevant criteria and using statistical models to identify the drivers of loan defaults.
                                    <p>  5. Visualization and Reporting: We will develop interactive dashboards and reports to visualize the loan portfolio performance and credit risk. These will include charts, tables, and maps that allow the user to filter and drill down into the loan portfolio data

                                        <h3>Conclusion and Recommendation</h3>
                                        <p>The analysis of FinTech loan data using Roll Rate Report, Loss Provisioning Report, and Vintage Analysis Report has provided insights into the credit risk of the loan portfolio. The automated and scalable solution developed for generating these reports has saved time and reduced errors compared to the manual process. The visualization and reporting of the loan portfolio data using interactive dashboards and reports have improved the user experience and facilitated credit decision-making. We recommend further analysis to identify the drivers of loan defaults and assess the sensitivity of the loan portfolio to economic shocks.
